/**
 * Weaker version of {@link Applicative}.
 *
 * This type class is exposed in addition to `Applicative` because
 * there are data types for which we can't implement `of`, but
 * that could still benefit from an `ap` definition. For example
 * in case of a `Map<K, ?>` we couldn't define `pure` for it
 * because we don't have a `K` key.
 *
 * Must obey this law:
 *
 * 1. Composition: `A.ap(A.ap(A.map(f => g => x => f(g(x)), a), u), v) <-> A.ap(a, A.ap(u, v))`
 *
 * Equivalent with the `Applicative` type class in the
 * [Fantasy-Land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) specification.
