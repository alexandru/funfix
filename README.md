Funfix is a library of data types for functional and asynchronous
programming in Javascript.

Inspired by [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
and [Monix](https://monix.io/).

## Usage

```
npm install --save funfix
```

### Features

High-level data types:

- [Option](https://funfix.org/api/classes/core_option.option.html),
  which is like the "Maybe" monadic type from Haskell
- [Either](https://funfix.org/api/classes/core_either.either.html),
  for working with values of two possible types
- [Try](https://funfix.org/api/classes/core_try.try.html),
  for capturing exceptional results and manipulating them as values
- [Eval](https://funfix.org/api/classes/effect_eval.eval.html)
  for suspending synchronous side effects and controlling evaluation
  (e.g. memoization, error handling)

Low-level data types and utilities:

- [IEquals](https://funfix.org/api/interfaces/core_std.iequals.html) interface
  for structural equality in [is](https://funfix.org/api/modules/core_std.html#is)
- [Cancelable](https://funfix.org/api/classes/exec_cancelable.cancelable.html) /
  [BoolCancelable](https://funfix.org/api/classes/exec_cancelable.boolcancelable.html),
  for describing composable cancellation actions
- [TimeUnit and Duration](https://funfix.org/api/modules/exec_time.html) for
  expressing timespans, along operations and conversions between time units
- [Scheduler](https://funfix.org/api/classes/exec_scheduler.scheduler.html)
  for scheduling units of work for asynchronous execution (also see
  [TestScheduler](https://funfix.org/api/classes/exec_scheduler.testscheduler.html)
  for simulating async execution and delays in tests)

More is coming (e.g. `Task`, etc)

See **[API Docs](https://funfix.org/api)**.

### Typescript or Flow?

Funfix supports both [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) type annotations out of the box.

It also makes the best use of the capabilities of each. For example Typescript has bivariant generics, but Flow supports variance annotations and Funfix makes use of them. Development happens in Typescript, due to better tooling, but both are first class citizens.

### Semantic versioning

[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

Funfix versioning follows the [sematic versioning (semver)](http://semver.org/) specification, meaning that versions have the `$major.$minor.$patch` format, where any `$major` increment means that a breaking change happened. It's also configured with a fully automated release process, triggered by any commits on master.
